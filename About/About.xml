  <description>The spiritual successor to Facial Stuff.

Adds hands and feet to pawns (currently only humans, haven't worked on Alien Races yet) including basic animations for work and walk cycles depending on the walk speed.
Also displays hands on weapons and carried things and can change the way weapons/carried stuff is displayed, meaning things will render behind if the pawn is facing north or west.

Features
Built upon Mlies SMYH mod, this version includes:
· FS animation for hands and feet for walking and working (WIP)
· New hand shape for making use of angles
· Fully colored hands n feet depending on the apparel coverage
· Weapons mostly following hands and will be drwan behind a pawn if facing east or north
· Smoother walk cycle animations by blending various speeds together
· Walk cycle selection depending on the actual speed and not the job urgency
· Preparations for a new animation system (WIP)
· Was working with Children School and Pregnancy the last time I tested (please avoid toddlers, they are basic quadrupeds not bipeds ;c) )
· There is also support for &lt;b&gt;Enable Oversized Weapons, Yayo's Combat 3, Yayo's Combat 3 Adopted, Yayo's Animation, RunAndGun&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Dual Wield.&lt;/b&gt; Hands and feet will follow the weapons even during the extra animations. 
Verified to work with &lt;b&gt;Combat Extended&lt;/b&gt;
Also shows hands when using &lt;b&gt;Grab your Tool&lt;/b&gt; (some mods like yayoAnimation might override this, I might release a tweaked build for yayo)

History
This mod is based on Mlie's &lt;b&gt;Show Me Your Hands&lt;/b&gt; which is based on &lt;b&gt;Clutter Weapon Hands&lt;/b&gt; by mrofa. The initial hand features of Facial Stuff were also based on Clutter, so using SMYH as a new and improved base with its better compatibility--and working with RW 1.3 from scratch--seemed to be the best option.

    Based on &lt;b&gt;Clutter Weapon Hands&lt;/b&gt; but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.

There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon. These settings can be exported and included in a mod to add native support.
All my "Continued"-mods should have native support.


&lt;size=24&gt;Settings&lt;/size&gt;
· Coloring the hands based on apparel/armor color
· Coloring the hands based on artificial limbs
· Resizing the hands based on the bodysize of the pawn, this also works with &lt;b&gt;Children&lt;/b&gt;
· Repositioning the hands based on the weaponsize, to support oversized weapons
· Showing the hands when pawns carry stuff
· Showing only one hand if the pawn is missing one
· Showing the hands at all times

&lt;size=24&gt;Credits&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;color=orange&gt;Arcanant&lt;/color&gt; for providing hand-definitions for a lot of mods.
&lt;color=orange&gt;Telefonmast&lt;/color&gt; for the support with the texture-code.
&lt;color=orange&gt;qux&lt;/color&gt; for the updated hand-texture.
