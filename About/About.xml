Pawns show their hands on their weapon when drafted. 
Should work with most weapons, vanilla and modded.
Works with roolos [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628211313]Dual Wield[/url]

Based on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171708109]Clutter Weapon Hands[/url] but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.

There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon.

Telefonmast for the support with the texture-code.
qux for the updated hand-texture.
