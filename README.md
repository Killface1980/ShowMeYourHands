Pawns show their hands on their weapon when drafted. 
Should work with most weapons, vanilla and modded.

Based on https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171708109]Clutter Weapon Hands but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.

There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon. These settings can be exported and included in a mod to add native support.
All my "Continued"-mods should have native support.

There is also support for https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038409475]Yayo's Combat 3, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1204108550]RunAndGun and https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628211313]Dual Wield. Hands will follow the weapons even during the extra animations.

Settings


-  Coloring the hands based on apparel/armor color
-  Resizing the hands based on the bodysize of the pawn, this also works with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2373187996]Children
-  Repositioning the hands based on the weaponsize, to support oversized weapons
