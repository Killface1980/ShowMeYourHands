Pawns show their hands on their weapon when drafted. 
Should work with most weapons, vanilla and modded.
Works with roolos https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628211313]Dual Wield

Based on https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171708109]Clutter Weapon Hands but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.

There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon. These settings can be exported and included in a mod to add native support.
